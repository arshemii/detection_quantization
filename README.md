# yolo_optimization
A simple script for optimizing YOLO models (v8 and v11)


--------------------------------
This repository is nothing but a simple script for optimizing YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 models.

It contains:
1. A simple layer fusing to have less complexity by fusing convolution layers and batch normalization layers.
   To learn about layer fusing:          https://proceedings.mlr.press/v157/o-neill21a/o-neill21a.pdf
2. A quantization workflow using "nncf" toolkit of OpenVino.
   To learn more about quantization:     https://paperswithcode.com/paper/post-training-quantization-for-neural
   To learn more about nncf:             https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/model-optimization.html

   ** To use this function, you need a subset of coco dataset (or any other dataset in the format compatible with YOLO models)
   ** See the comments in quantization.py to adjust the code for your models
